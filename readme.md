# SOLSTICE
## SOLidity Specification Translated from an InstAL Contract Expression
### What is this?
This is a 'programming code translator' written in Rust. It translates an InstAL specification to Solidity for the EVM.
### What is InstAL?
http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/instal/
### Why?
InstAL is a tool for specifying an institutional specification. The assumption is that this is probably quite a good way of describing an legal institution.
### Does it work?
Probably not. The code is currently incomplete. And the translator is not very user friendly, like, at all. You'll have to make sure your InstAL specification is written in a very precise way, and that won't be easy.
